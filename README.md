# Hand Gesture Recognition to Perform System Operations
The data model uses Deep learning, Convolutional Neural Networks and a dataset from [Multi-Modal Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/gti-upm/multimodhandgestrec). The program then uses an algorithm to recognise the background, segments the hand gesture and then recognises the gesture.
***
## Requirements
1. Python
2. OpenCV
3. Keras
4. NumPy
5. PIL
6. PyAutoGUI
7. scikit-learn
***
## Model
This Gesture Recognition model is divdied into two parts
1. [model.py](https://github.com/ani-poroorkara/handRecogz/blob/master/model.py)
2. [handTrak.py](https://github.com/ani-poroorkara/handRecogz/blob/master/handTrak.py)

### Run the model 
1. Download the datamodel folder
2. Run handTrak.py 

### Train your own model 
1. Run model.py
2. Structure the image folder and loop through images
3. Run the model
4. Save the model
